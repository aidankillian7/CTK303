        <p>I am interested in many aspects of technology from creative and technical aspects. I would always tinker with hardware and software to see how things work and make them work the way I wanted.</p>
        <p>I write programs, develop games, and an operating system technician. I love writing programs that would assist me in repetitive tasks that require a lot of labor to complete. I also write programs to solve problems and aid in my daily life. Over the years to have learned to inside and out of hardware and operating systems like Windows. For the past few years, I have been learning about Linux systems for desktop and server use.</p>
        <p>On the other end from the technical parts of technology, I also dive into the creative aspects of it. I love creating graphics works like photo editing and vector art. I love creating vector logos and single drawings. I am also great at 3D modeling in Blender and some animation. Not only do I like making static art, but also motion pictures. I love to create cinematic films in either real life or in games like GTA5. Editing clips and syncing them to music with timing and flow is also my specialty. </p>

                <h2>Dual Of Fate</h2>
                <p>Dual Of Fate is a Tarot card game that works like a auto battler. The game has 3 lanes and a truth table of what cards can be beat and how. When a player wins a round they can draw a Tarot card that will turn the games rules on its head and add rules like increaseing a power in a certain card to adding another lane. Currently I am working on making the game as a Unity game with full multiplayer capibilities.</p>
